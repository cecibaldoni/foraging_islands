# Shrew Foraging

I tried to write down this script to solve the mismatch but I feel like it won't be that useful. 
Anyway, The main thing that I think I found is the fact that the mismatches were caused by the frame adjustments at the beginning.
I say that because at the end of my script were I manage to put my data and the tracking together, my observations falls inside the buffer.
At the same time I'm very suspicious about the code I wrote because I'm not sure about the measuring unit that I used and I'm not sure it's homogeneous and correct. And the buffer have been made by me since I was struggling too much to take out the script from the for loop in the other file.
We can also see some result on the merged_with_islands because island_debug is always associated with the right island.
Anyway, I'm sceptical about this also because it's my first R script and I feel like I made it work as I wanted XD
